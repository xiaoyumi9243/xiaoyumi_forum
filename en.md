[Chinese](README.md)
# My Self-Made Forum
## Requirements
-- PHP version: 7.2.22 or higher
-- MySQL database support required
-- phpMyAdmin version: 4.9.0.1 or higher

## Super Important Notes
-- This forum has poor security, please do not use it in important environments.
-- After launching the forum, you must immediately register the 'admin' username. If someone else takes this username, they will become the administrator, and you'll have to delete the database and start over.

## Usage Instructions
-- First select your desired version and download it
-- Copy all downloaded files to your server (if it's a compressed file, extract it to the server), then edit the two configuration files: includes/config.php and config.php. Replace the database address, database username, database password, and database name with your actual information to complete the deployment.
-- Also download the SQL file [Download Now](https://github.com/xiaoyumi9243/xiaoyumi_forum/releases/)

## Forum Features
-- Only about 70KB in size, suitable for servers with limited space and bandwidth like InfinityFree. Redundant features have been removed, so there might be some bugs - please understand (will be fixed later).
-- Feature-rich admin panel that can manage various less commonly used functions.
-- Note: Version 1.0.0 doesn't have an admin panel. If you need the admin panel, please download version 2.0.0.
